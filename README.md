# Overview (Hangman)

A CLI based word guessing game where you need to guess the word to win the game. More features will be added whenever i get time.

### Why this?

This is an attempt of [Exercise #31](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2017/01/02/31-guess-letters.html) from my learning of pythong language. This program actually took 35 minutes to code including the help of [Google](https://www.google.com.pk) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (also practicing for Markdown syntaxes)

# Usage

```
python main.py
```

# Changelog

## 1.1
 - Added attempts limit to quit game if exceeded
 - Improvised algorithm to allow maximum attempts as per complexity of word.

## 1.0
 - Initial release.
